# Data Validation Module

## Overview:
The [Data Validation Module (DVM)](https://github.com/PIFSC-NMFS-NOAA/PIFSC-DataValidationModule) was developed to provide a framework to validate data entered in a given Oracle database based on flexible data validation criteria that can be developed and implemented in Oracle Views by a data manager/developer without requiring application development skills.  A series of data QC Views can be developed to identify problematic values in the database and implemented in the framework to allow each validation rule to be evaluated on the given Data Stream.  

## Prerequisites:
- Oracle 11g or higher

## Installing
- Installation instructions can be found in the [DVM Documentation](./docs/Data%20Validation%20Module%20Documentation.md#database_setup)

## Running the tests
- This process has been developed using the [Centralized Cruise Database](https://picgitlab.nmfs.local/centralized-data-tools/centralized-cruise-database) starting in version 0.23 (Git tag: cen_cruise_db_v0.23). Refer to the tagged versions of the CCD that match the version of the DVM (e.g. DVM_db_v1.0) for the corresponding automated test cases.
	- For more information review the [DVM Testing Documentation](https://picgitlab.nmfs.local/centralized-data-tools/centralized-cruise-database/-/blob/master/docs/packages/CDVM/test%20cases/CDVM%20Testing%20Documentation.md)
